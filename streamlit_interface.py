    Main function to run the Streamlit interface and execute the run function from file_processor.
    This file follows the dependency inversion principle, and separates UI from backend functionalities:
    Streamlit framework is used to render the GUI and manage file uploads.
    To use other approaches or frameworks: 
    1) Make sure to set up a GUI that allows users to upload files & enter text input for their questions.
    2) Import the run method from the flow_coordinator.py
    3) Get the response by running the run(files, user_question) method with the appropriate arguments.
